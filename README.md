1. The user is prompted to enter a number.
2. Program checks if the number is divisible by 2.
3. If it is, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

##Task 2:

#Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
Calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a 'for' loop.

##How It Works

1.A variable sum is initialized to 0.
2.A for loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 50.
3.Each number is added to sum.
4.Return the sum.
